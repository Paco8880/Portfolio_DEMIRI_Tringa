# Project 1 – PacoTechFix Solutions

In **Project 1**, I created a hypothetical firm called **PacoTechFix Solutions**, which operates in the **industrial machinery maintenance and support industry**. The CSV data files in this repository were **synthetically generated** using the **Faker library in Python**, alongside other libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy**, and **random.choice** to introduce realistic business logic.

## **Project Context**

To showcase my **prompt engineering skills**, I used **ChatGPT** to create a realistic scenario where it acts as a **stakeholder** of PacoTechFix Solutions.  
This stakeholder presents real-world business challenges that I, as a **business analyst**, need to address.  

This approach ensures:
- The problems are **unbiased** and **randomized**.
- It demonstrates my ability to **analyze diverse issues logically** rather than simply inventing problems from scratch.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Python** – Data generation and preprocessing.
- **Excel** – Initial data exploration.
- **PostgreSQL** – Storing and querying structured data.
- **Power BI** – Visualization and dashboard creation.

## **Business Problems Addressed**

1. **Declining Customer Satisfaction**  
   - Client feedback shows inconsistent satisfaction scores.  
   - Goal: Identify which **technicians** or **machine models** are causing dissatisfaction.

2. **High Machine Downtime**  
   - Some machines require frequent service calls, causing operational inefficiencies.  
   - Goal: Detect patterns to determine **which machine types fail most often**.

3. **Technician Performance Variability**  
   - Complaints indicate certain technicians take longer to resolve issues.  
   - Goal: Evaluate **technician performance** using service times and client feedback.

4. **Unclear Resource Allocation**  
   - Technician scheduling is unbalanced, with some overworked and others underutilized.  
   - Goal: Provide insights for **optimized technician assignment**.

5. **Profitability Impact**  
   - Frequent service calls on certain machines are driving up costs.  
   - Goal: Predict **machines likely to fail soon** to enable **proactive maintenance**.
