Welcome to my portfolio!  
This repository is a collection of projects that showcase the skills I have developed throughout my **Bachelor's and Master's studies**.  
Since I currently don't have a professional role where I can apply these skills, I have created this portfolio to demonstrate my abilities to **recruiters and employers**.

---

## **About This Portfolio**
- The data used in these projects is mostly **synthetic data generated by me using Python** or **datasets downloaded from public sources**.  
- Each project folder contains its own README with **detailed explanations** about the data, approach, and tools used.

## **Skills Demonstrated**
This portfolio highlights my expertise in:
- **SQL** â€“ Writing complex queries, joins, and analytical functions.
- **Power BI** â€“ Building interactive dashboards and DAX measures.
- **Excel** â€“ Advanced formulas, pivot tables, and automation techniques.
- **Python** â€“ Data cleaning, analysis, visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
- **Data Modeling** â€“ Creating meaningful data structures and relationships for analysis.

## **Projects**
- [**Project 1 â€“ **](./Project1/README.md)
- [**Project 2 â€“ **](./Project2/README.md)
- [**Projects done for my masters classes**](./General_Projects/README.md)

*(More projects will be added soon.)*

## **Purpose**
This repository is my way of **showing recruiters that I am a well-rounded Business Analyst** who can transform data into insights using a mix of business and technical skills.
